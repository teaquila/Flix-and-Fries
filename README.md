# Flix-and_Fries
"Flix & Fries" project is my java end semester project.The project is a  small 
version of IMDB(sort of). Here the users can find the information and reviews of few highly ranked movies and tv series! The user can also 
submit their own reviews and rating!! 
Made completely using java and GUI is based on (Swings), it comprises of all the 
object oriented concepts and features like file handling, exception handling, interfaces and packages.
