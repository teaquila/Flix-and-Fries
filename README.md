# Flix-and_Fries
"Flix & Fries" project is my end semester project. Our project is a  small 
version of IMDB. Here the user can find the information and reviews of few highly ranked movies and tv series! The user can also 
submit their own reviews and rating!! 
Made completely using java based on GUI (Swings), it comprises of all the 
object oriented concepts and features like file handling, exception handling, interfaces and packages.
